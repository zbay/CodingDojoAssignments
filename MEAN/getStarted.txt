Resume: noteform.component

FULL STACK:
1. Move Angular project into Express file directory, a sibling of server folder and server.js
2. ng build -w, within the angular project folder. This generates dist folder.
3. Edit server.js file to define 'dist' folder directory as the static folder.
	A. app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '/my-angular-app/dist')));
4. Need bodyParser.json() to indicate that post requests will be json formatted
5. Angular catch-all routing
    app.all("*", (req,res,next) => {
        res.sendFile(path.resolve("./public/dist/index.html"))
    });

1. Assume node and @angular/cli are installed (globally)
1.5. npm init -y
2. npm install express
3. npm install ejs
	This is for templating
4. npm install bower
	This is for front-end libraries
5. npm install body-parser
	To handle post data
6. npm install express-sessions
	To handle sessions (optional)
npm install mongoose
npm install bcrypt-nodejs

7. use --save after npm installs if you want to update package.json
8. cd c:/"Program Files"/MongoDB/Server/3.4/bin/
9. ./mongod (bash) or mongod.exe (cmd prompt)
10. cd c:/"Program Files"/MongoDB/Server/3.4/bin/ in another window
11. ./mongo or mongo.exe
12. ng new project_name --routing
13. ng generate component component_name
14. ng generate service service_name
15. Make sure to include Http and FormModule

Deploy (in addition to what's there):
1. At root
2. sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/ubuntu/.config
3. sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(npm config get prefix)/{lib/node_modules,bin,share}
4. sudo npm install @angular/cli
5. Go to project/public, sudo npm install, and ng build


Notes:
1. Set PATH for node modules...	set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Users\zlwillia\AppData\Roaming\npm;
2. Angular: in brackets means it's going from .ts to .html. In parentheses it's going from .html to .ts. 
When you have both, it's a two-way binding


REACT:
1. Need react, react-dom, and  npm libraries
2. create-react-app {{your-project-name}}
3. npm install react-router-dom
